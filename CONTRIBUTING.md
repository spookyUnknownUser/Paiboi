Thank you for considering contributing to Paiboi.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

# Ground Rules
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution
At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Send a pull request.

# How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email me instead.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
1. What version of Paiboi are you using?
2. What operating system are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?


# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Paiboi, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Pai Boi has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
